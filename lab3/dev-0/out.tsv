Bosniaks are protesting against Croatia's plans for a radioactive waste repository
Hundreds of people gathered in northwestern Bosnia on Friday to protest against neighboring Croatia's plans to deposit some of the waste from the region's only nuclear power plant close to the Bosnian border and a major river known for its natural beauty.
Demonstrators in the Bosnian town of Novi Grad demanded that Croatia abandon plans to build a landfill in the former military barracks in Trgovska Gora and pledged to fight the project.
Waste from the Krško nuclear power plant would be stored at the facility.
"Bosnians holding banners with the words ""I want a healthy future"" and ""Stop - (river) Una needs us"" said that a radioactive waste repository could threaten the Una River and the lives of some 250,000 inhabitants."
We have to say NO
"Miroslav Drljaca, the mayor of Novi Grad, told the crowd."
We must fight to protect our way of life and our Una.
"Located in Slovenia, the Krško power plant, built in the 1980s, also belongs to Croatia."
Representatives from both countries are expected to meet next week to discuss additional landfills.
Croatian public television HRT said on Friday that in Croatia it has not yet been decided whether to build a landfill on its own or pay for the storage of some waste in a new facility constructed by Slovenia.
"Croatian Environment and Energy Minister Tomislav Coric told reporters that Croatia also has a problem with the disposal of institutional waste from schools, hospitals and prisons, and hopes to find a comprehensive solution."
"In Bosnia, activist officials and residents on all sides of the country's ethnic divide urged Croatia to find another location in a part of the country closer to the plant."
"Why is Croatia, with all its territory, saying that Trgovska Gora in Bosnia is the best place? - asked Drljaca."
We must not be humiliated by them!

The US Congress has agreed to sell 32 F-35 aircraft to Poland
"The US Congress, for the statutory 15 days from the approval by the State Department of the possible purchase by Poland of 32 F-35 multi-role fighters, did not object to this transaction, which means that the last condition was met before the start of purchase negotiations."
"The Congressional decision, while not unexpected, is of great political importance."
"After approval of the sale by the State Department, and now by Congress, I see no major obstacles, said John V. Venable, senior defense policy adviser at Washington Conservative Heritage Foundation think tank."
"The expert explained that under the Arms Export Control Act of 1976, the federal government, represented by the Department of State, must notify Congress of any planned sale of arms abroad 15 days before signing the contract if the value of such a transaction for arms sales to a NATO member country exceeds 50 million dol."
The value of the proposed transaction for the purchase of 32 F-35 fighters by Poland is estimated at $ 65 billion. This amount includes the cost of technical and logistical assistance for auxiliary equipment and pilot training.
"The main supplier of the F-35 aircraft - if this transaction is finally finalized - will be the American defense concern Lockheed Martin, and its subcontractor is the manufacturer of engines for F-35A fighter jets, Pratt and Whitney."
Proposals to purchase American fifth generation F-35 fighters on behalf of the Polish authorities were submitted in May by Defense Minister Mariusz Błaszczak.
The Polish offer was discussed in June this year during the meeting between President Andrzej Duda and President Donald Trump at the White House.
"The implementation of this agreement, if it is finalized, will be supervised by representatives of the Pentagon as part of the Foreign Military Sales (FMS) program."
"Under the FMS program, Poland has already acquired, among others Patriot anti-missile system."
The price of one F-35 fighter at the time of the purchase offer by Poland was - without armaments and technical assistance - about $ 892 million.
"According to PAP, American military experts who wished to remain anonymous, such a price given in the preliminary negotiations was ""the maximum price much higher than the price to be negotiated""."
"Prices are plummeting, now the price of a single F-35 is below $ 80 million, much less than the Eurofighter, which does not have the same advantages as the F-35, pointed out by Venable."
PAP interlocutors expressed the hope that the final negotiations on the purchase of American combat aircraft by Poland will be completed this year.
The possible participation of Polish subcontractors in this transaction - i.e. the offset - will be discussed directly with American producers of F-35 fighters.

It is a rare condition that usually involves the parent exaggerating the symptoms or causing symptoms to make it look like their child is sick.
What are the symptoms of surrogate Münchhausen syndrome?
"Symptoms of this disease may vary, but the NHS is looking for examples of behavior below:"
Convincing medical staff that a child who looks healthy feels bad.
Exaggerating or making up symptoms.
"Falsifying the results to make the child sick, e.g. administering glucose to urine samples to make it appear that the child has diabetes."
"Inducing symptoms of the disease, e.g. by giving children unnecessary drugs and other substances."
How common is surrogate Münchhausen syndrome?
It is difficult to estimate how common this disorder occurs because many cases of the disease go unreported.

Boris Johnson referred to the police oversight body due to a close relationship with businesswoman Jennifer Arcuri
The independent police investigation office IOPC will investigate the possibility of initiating an investigation against the Prime Minister to find out whether he has committed a criminal offense while in his public office as Mayor of London.
"Greater London Council (GLA) said in a statement that its oversight inspector had registered an ""issue related to the proceeding"" of the Prime Minister in connection with accusations of preferential treatment of Arcuri based on a close relationship between them."
"You can speak of a ""procedural issue"" when there is information that indicates a possible crime, he said."
This does not mean that it has somehow been proven.
The IOPC will now consider whether it is necessary to investigate this matter.
"The matter was referred to the IOPC, which deals with complaints against members of the police force in England and Wales."
She was transferred to this police oversight body because Johnson was then in the position of the equivalent of the Police Commissioner and Criminal Investigator.
Johnson denied that there were any irregularities in his close relationship with Arcuri.
"Earlier, he said that he would comply with the London council order and would provide details of his relationship with Arcuri, but insisted the council was ""focusing on the wrong issue""."
"The order follows a report by The Sunday Times that an American Arcuri, who moved to London seven years ago, was given £ 126,000 in budget money as well as privileged access to three foreign trade missions headed by the then mayor of Johnson."
"As a result of this report, the government has frozen a grant of £ 100,000 to Arcuri-owned Hacker House pending investigation."
The government faces embarrassing questions about the pre-funding screening procedure.
"Digitization Minister Matt Warman told the House of Commons that his department's employees had ""habitually exercised due diligence"" and that the company had a UK telephone number."
"However, according to numerous reports, calls to the number were redirected to the California office where Arcuri, 34, is now expected to live."
"The prime minister's close relationship with the businesswoman ""was an open secret for the staff."""
The GLA's decision to refer the prime minister's case to the IOPC's independent police investigation authority was met with discontent at 10 Downing Street.
"According to a source around a senior government official, it represents a ""politically motivated attack"" and its timing - on the eve of the Conservation Party conference - is ""overtly political""."
"The supervisory inspector did not provide any evidence to support the allegations, and the prime minister did not get a chance to respond before publishing the press release late Friday evening, the source said."
Neither the citizens nor the media will fall for such an openly political act.
"Earlier today, journalists from The Standard were told that Johnson's close relationship with a California businesswoman who was assisted by the London tourism and promotion agency was an ""open secret"" for employees."
"Former senior staff from London Partners (LP) recalled that Arcuri received seats during Johnson's overseas trade trips as mayor, despite the fact that her businesses were not considered ""credible"" at the time."
Third charged with drug offenses in connection with Mac Miller's death
"LOS ANGELES (AP) - In connection with last year's death of rapper Mac Miller as a result of a drug overdose, a third man was arrested and charged with drug offenses."
"According to court documents from Stephen Walter, it is suspected that he was selling counterfeit fentanyl-treated oxycodone pills that Miller had in his possession before his death last September as a result of an accidental overdose of alcohol and fentanyl cocaine, a potent opioid responsible for the ""epidemic"" that claimed several thousand lives in the United States United."
"Walter is accused of delivering pills that another man, Cameron Pettit, sold to Miller."
Court documents unsealed on Tuesday reveal that Pettit had been receiving drugs from Walter throughout August.
"Ryan Reavis, who was arrested earlier this week in Lake Havasu City, Arizona, is suspected of serving as Walter's ""courier"" delivering the pills to Pettit."
"Neither of these men were directly charged with the manslaughter of Miller, nor have any of them put forward a line of defense in their case."
"Walter, who has been paroled in a 2005 drug case, is in custody and has already been sentenced to five months' imprisonment for violating the conditions of his release."
"Prosecutors dealing with the case first reported on Thursday by the TMZ celebrity website demand that Walter remain in custody awaiting trial, saying there is a serious risk of the defendant's escape."
The reply to the message left on his lawyer's answering machine didn't come right away.
Pettit was charged in federal court on September 4 and his attorney declined to comment.
"The words of Miller's rhyming songs are an honest conversation about his depression and drug use, thanks to which he has gained fans among the greatest hip-hop stars."
"Hailing from Pittsburgh, Miller who real name was Malcolm James Myers McCormick had a relationship for two years with singer Ariana Grande that ended earlier in 2018."
"After his death on Instagram, she published a touching film with Miller and the song ""Thank U Next"" in which she mentions him with love."
Miller is one of the musicians whose deaths in recent years have been linked to opioid abuse.
"Matthew Roberts, guitarist of the band 3 Doors Down, also died from an overdose in 2016 and found both fentanyl and hydrocodone in his system."
"This article has made a change: the correct spelling of Walter's name is ""Stephen"" and not ""Steven""."
The 9-year-old Nigerian creates over 30 games for mobile devices
The 9-year-old makes a hide-and-seek game with the free Scratch 2 programming app.
Scratch 2 allows users to create animation games and stories online or offline.
"So far, Basil has generated over 30 games for mobile devices with its help."
In today's game there is a bat that hides according to the program.
The player scores a point each time he catches a bat that comes out of the hideout.
I learned how to create games in an accelerated course.
"""Now I create them when I'm bored,"" said Basil CNN."
"In March, his dad enrolled him in a five-day accelerated course for children aged 5 to 15."
The course organized by Codefest International was aimed at providing children like Basil with access to new technologies such as robotics and virtual reality.
"The boy's father, Basil Okpara senior, claims that Basil played a lot of games on mobile devices."
"When he was 4 I bought him a tablet as he was always grabbing the phone and playing on it.
He played a lot of Candy Crush and Temple Run said CNN's father."
"But Basil's interest in making games grew when he was 7, and he was scolded for spending all his time playing games."
"One day he was playing on a tablet as usual and he was so engrossed in it that I got upset, my father said."
"Out of anger, I said, ""You're just playing games, can't you think about making your own games for others to play?"""
"Saying these words, I was nervous and didn't think he would take them seriously, ""he added."
"From then on, Basil showed an active interest in learning how to create his own games, prompting his parents to buy a laptop and enroll it in a course where he learned the basics of game development."
"Basil, who wants to be a scientist in the future, gives his games titles based on their content."
"One of his games ""Mosquito mash"" is available on the Google play store."
"Africa has the largest population of young people in the world and, like Basil, this population holds the leadership of innovation on the continent."
Two Nigerian 12-year-olds were recently hailed for using codes to create robots to separate their work from home.
"In May, the Acrobot team from a girls' high school in Ghana won the Robofest 2019 competition for programming robots for stacking crates."
"And thanks to the growing investments of tech giants like Google and Microsoft in Africa, Basil and his peers are well on their way to a career as coding stars."
The former chairman of the Republican Party of North Carolina will plead guilty to lying on corruption
Court papers filed on Friday show that the former chairman of the Republican Party of North Carolina will admit in court that he lied to federal agents investigating the corruption of a major political donor.
Robin Hayes is due to plead guilty next Wednesday.
"From a factual basis document prepared as part of a defense settlement and signed by Hayes's attorney, Hayes knew that he was making a false statement to FBI agents investigating the corruption in 2018."
The defense settlement was sealed and it is not clear from the factual basis which charges Hayes will plead.
"Initially, he was accused of collusing corruption and giving false testimony."
Prosecutors accused former Congressman Hayes of participating in an insurance company's government plan to direct campaign donations to the country's top insurance regulator in exchange for special treatment.
Principal Greg Lindberg and two of his associates were accused of trying to bribe state insurance commissioner Mike Causey.
"Lindberg is the founder of an insurance and investment firm and in recent years one of the state's top political donors, donating more than $ 5 million to national and federal candidates and committees since 2016."
"He mainly supported the goals and politicians of the Republican Party, however he made donations to the Democrats as well."
His lawyer did not reply to Friday's e-mail requesting a comment.
Hayes' attorney Kearns Davis did not reply to Friday's email requesting comment.
Court papers on Friday revealed that Hayes lied to FBI agents in August 2018 when he said he had not spoken to Causey about employees of the state's Department of Insurance.
"According to the factual basis document, Hayes actually spoke to the Insurance Commissioner about Lindberg's request to make changes to the staff employed by the market regulator."
Prosecutors say Hayes also helped Lindberg to arrange a meeting with Causey and that he discussed the bribe directly with the regulator.
"According to an April indictment, Lindberg required special treatment for his insurance business and planned to donate up to $ 2 million to Causey's re-campaign in 2020."
The indictment shows that the collusion also included a request to change the official of the department that controlled Lindberg's enterprise.
Republican Causey reported the alleged corruption attempt to federal agents and helped them gather evidence on the case.
No charges were brought against him.
"According to the indictment, Lindberg's accomplice ordered Hayes to donate $ 250,000 to the Causey campaign during an interview that also included Lindberg and Causey."
"During the conversation, Hayes initially protested that the transfer of this amount of money would attract attention, but the accusation shows that he eventually resigned."
"Whatever you all want to do, we'll do, said Hayes, according to the indictment."
"Okay, I'll take care of it."
A spokeswoman for the federal attorney did not reply to the e-mail asking for more information about the settlement.

"The response from the many anti-bullying groups that work with us, as well as from mental health organizations, was really positive, Garlick said."
"Eliminating this counter will make people focus on the quality of their interactions and the quality of the content, not the number of likes or reactions."
"Sharing with others through the platform is expected to be more enjoyable and not perceived as competition, she said."
Garlick ensured that companies that base their activities on Facebook will continue to receive the same indicators and observations to which they had access so far.
She stated that it was too early to say whether the test would be extended to other countries as was the case with Instagram when Australia Canada Brazil New Zealand Japan Italy and Ireland were tested.
"As in the case of Instagram, which belongs to Facebook, there is no indication of when the experiment will end and whether the change will be made permanent."
"Initial user comments on the new Instagram rules were positive, but at this stage we are still learning and listening to feedback, 'she said."
"Commenting on the site of the world experiment, Garlick said that Australia has very active technically savvy Facebook and Instagram users."
We believe that this is an amazing country that will provide us with reliable opinions indicating whether the new experience is valuable to people using our services or not.

Brother sentenced to life imprisonment for the honor killing of social media star Qandeel Baloch
"Qandeel Baloch, who became a star thanks to photos posted on social networks, was strangled in July 2016."
"The brother of Pakistani social media star Qandeel Baloch was found guilty of her murder on Friday and sentenced to life imprisonment for the country's most famous ""honor killing"" in the patriarchal country."
"Baloch, who became famous by publishing daring selfies - polite by Western standards but considered provocative in highly misogynistic Pakistan - was strangled in July 2016."
Her brother Muhammad Waseem was arrested.
"A few days later he said in a press conference that he had no remorse for his actions and stated that he had ""obviously"" murdered his sister and that her behavior was ""unacceptable""."
His lawyer Sardar Mehmood told AFP that a court in the western city of Multan found his client guilty and sentenced him to life in prison in a long-awaited sentence.
"Inshallah (God willing) will be acquitted by a higher court, he said."
"Earlier, Baloch's mother Anwar Mai told AFP that she hoped her son would be acquitted."
"He is innocent.
It was my daughter, and this is my son, she said."
The Baloch murder hit the top of the world's news services and renewed calls for action against the so-called epidemic. honor killings in which victims - usually women - are killed for breaking patriarchal social rules.
"Women were set on fire, strangled and shot or stabbed for offenses such as choosing their own husband or - as in the case of Baloch - for bringing ""shame"" to their family by manifesting their sexuality."
The killings are usually committed by a close relative.
"According to Pakistani law, Qisas (blood money) and Diyat (retaliation) can ask the relatives of the victim for forgiveness."
"Three months after the Baloch murder, parliament passed new legislation introducing a life sentence for honor killings."
"However, whether the murder is considered an honorary crime is left to the discretion of the judge, which means that the murderers may theoretically rely on a different motive and be acquitted."
"In the case of Baloch, her parents first insisted that their son should not be shown favors under any circumstances."
"However, devastated by the thought that he might lose him too, they changed their mind and declared that they wanted his acquittal."
"The international outcry caused by the murder prompted the Pakistani state to take an unprecedented step and declare itself heir with his parents, forcing the case to move forward."
One of Baloch's more famous accomplishments is offering to do a striptease in front of a Pakistani cricket team and wearing a low-cut purple gown on Valentine's Day.

"The roots of the ""honor"" killing lie in the tribal social norms that still dominate South Asia and in particular regulate women's behavior, although men can also be victims."

"On Friday, the United Nations organization said rising violence had doubled the number of people displaced from northwestern Nigeria to around 40,000 in the past four months. people."
"The UN refugee agency said the unrest has created a ""new humanitarian emergency"" that requires an interagency effort to raise $ 355 million in new funding by the end of the year."
"Babar Baloch, a spokesman for the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, said the Islamist group Boko Haram, which has been leading the uprising in the north of the country for a decade, is not responsible for the recent attacks."
The rise in violence in the Nigerian states of Sokoto Zamfara and Katsina over the past 10 months is rather the result of the actions of organized armed groups.
"It paints a terrifying picture of anarchy and insecurity, he told reporters on Friday."
"He reported frequent reports of kidnappings, torture, extortion murders and sexual assaults by attackers who also destroy homes and steal belongings."
Military and police were deployed to fight criminals in the region.
"However, the military is being distracted from fighting Boko Haram and the Islamic State branch in West Africa that broke off from its former grouping in 2016."
"Refugees do not come with the names of the groups, he said."
"Instead, they come with horrible stories."
Most refugees find their way to neighboring Niger.
"In a statement, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees said he expected more people to flee to Niger in the coming months as the security situation deteriorated, particularly in the state of Sokoto."
A new trial date has been set for a man accused of killing a woman and two children
A new trial date has been scheduled for a Guatemalan man accused of killing an Iowa resident and her two children.
Polk County Court records show that 31-year-old Marvin Escobar-Orellana has been charged with three first-degree murders under the false name originally given to the police by authorities: Marvin Esquivel-Lopez.
He pleaded not guilty.
Police said he fatally shot 29-year-old Flores-Rodriguez her 11-year-old daughter and 5-year-old son on July 16 at their home in Des Moines.
"Court records show that the new date of the hearing, January 27, will give representatives of both parties more time to prepare."
U.S. Immigration and Customs officials say Escobar-Orellana is in the United States illegally and was deported twice prior to the shooting.
"In 2010, he was convicted of illegally entering the US."
The Sun: Boris Johnson in the face of cabinet rebellion to lower Brexit demands and reach compromise agreement with Brussels
"Just three weeks before the final summit of EU leaders, fears are growing among the most important people in the country in the vicinity of the prime minister that he does not have enough time to win more important concessions."
Boris Johnson faces the risk of a government revolt to lower its demands on Brexit and reach a compromise deal with the EU.
"There has been a stalemate in the negotiations over a new customs regime that would replace the backstop mechanism for Ireland as Brussels described the proposals for other arrangements offered by Johnson as ""impracticable""."
The Crown ministers expect the EU decision-makers led by German head Angela Merkel to offer the criticized Tory leader a last-minute compromise in the form of a three-year time limit for the implementation of the backstop mechanism.
"The Sun journalists spoke to three different cabinet ministers, all of whom are gearing up to confront the prime minister after the annual Tory conference next week in Manchester."
"They will demand that the prime minister abandon the ""aggressive"" strategy developed by his close aide Dominik Cummings of trying to bluff the EU and threaten to leave the EU without a deal, and then accept his last-minute offer by the EU."
"One cabinet minister described the shattering Supreme Court verdict ruling on Tuesday to end the suspension of parliament as a ""wake-up call"" and added: ""The only way we can leave the European Union on October 31 is by contract."
"We will never overcome arithmetic in the House of Commons, which works against us."
The prime minister must now bow to what he is able to get.
Aggressiveness does not pay: it is clear that Cummings' plan backfired.
We cannot fight battles on so many fronts.
The second cabinet minister has pledged to tell Johnson to try to push past Prime Minister Theresa May's deal if all else fails.
"The minister said: ""If I have to tell the prime minister to bring the agreement proposed by Theresa May back to the House of Commons."""
"In terms of numbers, there are chances for it to be voted through and everyone is very anxious to finish this topic."
"If we are forced to extend the deadline, it's over for Boris Johnson and it's over for all of us."
John Major accused Boris Johnson of not taking negotiations seriously.
"In a biting speech, the former first Tory minister said: ""The prime minister tells us that he wants a deal with the European Union."
"However, we do not see him sitting in Brussels and working on it."
"Instead, he wrestles with bulls in Scotland, checks the eggs in Wales and argues with citizens on the main streets of the city - all in front of the world as if an election campaign was already underway. """
"A spokesman for the current prime minister admitted yesterday that the deal was still distant and added: ""No one should have any illusions: it is a very long way to secure an agreement."
"However, the spokesman also said Benn's law implementing a three-month Brexit postponement in the absence of an agreement ""actively weakens our negotiating position"" in Brussels."
"He said: ""There is no doubt that this law makes our negotiations difficult, but despite it, the prime minister and his colleagues are still trying to make progress thanks to their hard work."""
Brexit secretary Stephen Barclay returns to Brussels today for more talks with Michel Barnier on the EU side.
They will be discussing a book on how the entire Irish food and livestock zone functions.

Perfectly imperfect
The mongrel was about to be put to sleep.
"However, this was prevented."
The bitch was transported from Romania to Great Britain by Beacon Animal Rescue Center.
The photo of the dog was posted on Facebook.
Kate Comfort fell in love with the pet at first sight.
"Initially, I had difficulty convincing my husband to adopt because we already had three dogs, she said."
The woman decided that she would take care of the bitch until someone adopted her.
But still no one came forward.
"The fact that nobody wanted her made me want to take care of her more and more.
She was sensitive and she needed love, she told Kate."
"Eventually, the couple decided to adopt Bonnie."
"Our Bonnie is perfectly imperfect.
We love her as she is, and if anyone doesn't like the way she looks, that's his problem, not ours, the woman said."
Bonnie has become a social media star over time.
"She is followed by over 14,000 on Instagram. Internet users."
Lorraine Kelly: It was said that I would never make a career on TV with a Glasgow accent
"According to Lorraine Kelly, television chiefs said that due to the Glasgow accent she would ""never make a career"" as a presenter."
"Recalling her 35-year career in the television industry, Kelly, 59, admitted that she felt ""very nervous"" prior to her first appearance on the screen."
I was only 25 and I was very nervous - she said.
When I was working at BBC Scotland as an information retrieval specialist the boss of bosses said that my Glasgow accent would make me never successful on TV.
I traveled to London to meet the entire TV team and watch the show broadcast before taking over from the Glasgow office.
I will never forget the interview with star Bette Davis by Anne Diamond and Mike Morris that morning.
I couldn't believe I was in the same room with a living legend.
I knew this was where I wanted to stay.
"Before Kelly became a Scottish TV correspondent in 1984, she began her career as a reporter for a local newspaper in East Kibride, Scotland."
"She then started hosting programs like ""GMTV"", ""ITV Breakfast"" and ""Daybreak"", and later launched her morning show ""Lorraine"" which was named after her name."
She will celebrate the 35th anniversary of her career with a special program during which she will remember her best remembered moments and interviews.
"The presenter said that the secrets of her long experience in television are ""passion and enthusiasm"" and ""curiosity"", adding: ""You have to work hard."
Be honest and authentic.
Prepare for programs and be both interested and interesting.
"When she remembers the media reports that touched her emotions, Kelly reveals that it was ""very difficult"" for her to cover the Dunblane attack."
I had no idea that many families of killed or injured children were watching our Dunblane show live the day after the horrific murder of sixteen children and their teacher.
"One of the mothers of Pam Ross, whose 5-year-old daughter Joanna was murdered, asked me for a private meeting during which we talked for many hours in her house."
The whole meeting was quiet and Pam Ross and I have been friends since Joanna's funeral I attended.
"She added that it was ""extremely difficult"" to interview Kate and Gerry McCann shortly after their daughter Madeleine disappeared in 2007 and that she ""really admires their strength and courage."""
They have to deal with the pain because they don't know what happened to their beloved daughter and put up with the most horrible comments from the internet trolls.
I am with them with all my heart.
Lorraine Kelly's 35th Anniversary TV show will start at 8:30 am on Monday 30 September at ITV station.
Zimbabwe: Chiwenga feared imprisonment
A senior government official claimed that Vice President Constantino Chiwenga had rejected the offer of late President Robert Mugabe to take over at the height of the coup because he feared imprisonment in order to confirm the military takeover in November 2017.
"As reported last week by The Zimbabwe Independent, Mugabe offered Vice President Chiwenga to assume the presidency during his coup negotiations with the military."
"However, a senior government official announced on social media that Chiwenga did not decline the offer out of fear but because he had reviewed Mugabe's plan to use it to prove to world leaders and the African Union (AU) that he had in fact lost in the coup."
"In a thread on Twitter that confirmed that the 37-year-old ruler of Zimbabwe wanted to hand over power to Vice President Chiwenga and not President Emmerson Mnangagwa Jamwanda 2, on which government officials confirmed he was a senior government official in the Office of the President and the Council of Ministers, it was claimed that at that time there was intensive negotiations on this matter."
Government officials claimed that Mugabe had contacted Chiwenga through one of his envoys when he realized that power was slipping out of his hands.
"Mediation between the military authorities and the deceased ex-president took three steps, according to a senior government official."
"The official claimed that among the participants of the negotiations was the spokesman for President George Charamba, the then head of the Central Intelligence Organization Aaron Nhepera and the clergyman representing the Roman Catholic bishop Fidelis Mukonori."
The former head of Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe Gideon Gono was another element since Mugabe sent him on a one-man mission to pass the presidency offer to Chiwenga who was head of the Zimbabwe Defense Forces (SOZ).
"The man who, after his death, was considered an icon of Africa even more than in his lifetime, tried in vain to obtain condemnation from the AU by trying to persuade other African leaders to intervene."
The president's offer to the then Chief of Defense Forces (SSO) Chiwenga by the late (Mugabe) was not a choice.
"It was a desperate act to save a situation that had accelerated dangerously fast, removing part of the deceased's family, an official (Jamwanda) wrote."
But there was also some political temptation by which the deceased sought to turn things around in a completely non-diplomatic way.
"Suffice it to recall that the commanders stated that they did not overthrow or overthrow the constitutional order, which would be the cause of their conflict with the AU's position on the coups."
"The deceased (Mugaba) hoped the SSO (Chiwenga) would then take the bait, violently breaking the leadership's claims that they had not overthrown the constitutional order."
"The hope for the deceased (Mugabe) was the fact that the AU, which, by the way, was still highly confused about the whole situation and how it fitted into its theoretical taxonomy of coups, would then have no choice but to describe it as a coup and therefore a call for military intervention would be plausible."
It was in this spirit and with such calculation that this offer was made.
Officials claimed that Mugabe made this move when he realized that the defense forces were no longer ready to protect him.
They said Mugabe was forced to sign a resignation letter after warning the strongman that he was risking a Gaddafi-style lynching.
Military chiefs told him that they would not turn their rifles against the citizens if they went to his Blue Roof residence.
"And at the same time, Mugabe had two desires - to save his family and prove that the army took power, ""the official added."
The then SSO and commanders read the assumptions correctly.
"The Messenger (Gono) carrying this desperate message was made to understand - through a powerful metaphor - that isu tiri vemakwapa-makwapa (we belong to the camouflage sect, i.e. the army), we are not politicians, nor are we competing with each other on the political level, argued a senior government official."
"Government officials say the military has alerted military commanders in the area via attachés who are in Zimbabwe that they are not going to overthrow Mugabe but to crack down on the ""criminals"" surrounding him."
Mugabe attempted to use the same strategy to tempt Mnangagwa again from his brief exile in South Africa so that they could talk about the coup and succession.
"In addition to negotiating with the army, Mugabe also sought help in the region."
"South Africans who are a key part of the process - not only because of their economic and regional power, but also because the then president Jacob Zuma was president of the Sadc - refused to intervene but made it clear that if the army invaded the house of Mugabe as it repeatedly threatened in the background South African troops will be in Harare without delay."
"It didn't work because Putin and African leaders didn't take this route, an informant told the Independent."
"China needs strong leadership or it will ""collapse,"" according to the policy document"
"China needs strong unified leadership from the Communist Party or the country will ""collapse,"" the government said in a policy document released on Friday, on the eve of the 70th anniversary of the People's Republic of China."
The Chinese government's press office reported in a white paper that the country's successes since the Communists took power 70 years ago boil down to party leadership.
China occupies a large area with complex national conditions and administrative difficulties are rare here.
"The document mentions that without a uniform and strong leadership force, China will move towards division and disintegration, which will be catastrophic for the world."
"The Chinese authorities have long used a hard-handed policy when solving problems, as in the case of suppressing the pro-democratic protests in Beijing in 1989, justifying it with the need to maintain the stability of the country."
"Strongly ruling President Xi Jinping, who on Tuesday will lead the celebration of the world's second-largest economy since taking office in late 2012, has further tightened party rule and imposed sanctions against those who may challenge power."
Xi also oversees the military modernization program that has upset the region.
"The document stated that China is not seeking to export its development model, nor does it want to import any foreign models, seeking only peace and not ""hegemony""."
The Chinese do not have the conquest of other nations or world domination in their genes.
"In modern times, China has been oppressed by great powers, and wars and unrest have left a deep mark on it as a result of the suffering it has suffered; China will never cause others the suffering it has experienced."
China is celebrating this anniversary in uncertain times for a country caught in a bitter trade war with the United States and facing challenges due to a slowing economy as well as anti-government protests in Chinese-controlled Hong Kong.
"The document says that China will never ""trade"" its most important interests or allow anything to harm its sovereignty."
"With regard to the country's trade dispute with Washington, the document stated that ""the danger of trade wars and a further increase in tariffs do not solve the problems."""
"China is a mature economy with a full industrial system, a complete industrial chain, a broad market place and a strong economic growth rate."
"The document added that ""trade wars will never weaken it."""
"China is sure that it is able to face the difficulties, turn the crisis into new opportunities and open a new world."
It also added that the United States should look rationally at China's development because China does not intend to question the position of the United States or to replace the United States.
"The United States cannot control China, and it is even less likely to stop China's development."
"Restraining and weakening other countries, and transferring domestic disagreements overseas will not give the United States a strong position."
Jacek Pałkiewicz's world: Dubai's true face
"The Dubai emirate is a place that is still looking for its own identity, torn between the Bedouin religious tradition, Islamic radicalism and progressive extremism."
"This trend-setting leader in world tourism awakens the imagination and desires, craving the vanity of wealthy snobbish hotels and attracting investors and traders seeking fortune with the status of a tax haven."
"Websites infect with enthusiasm for this dream city, an exciting temple of luxury and a concentrated concentration of 21st century architecture in one."
"Established on the sands rich in oil, the emirate has become Eden for those who love luxury five-star hotels, beautiful weather and swimming pools located hundreds of meters above the ground."
"Many admire the splendor that is present here, appreciate the creative hyperactivity and the hysterical pursuit of avant-garde."
"Here is a city whose motto says it all: ""surprise, dazzle and charm""."
And at almost every step.
"But there are also those who can look at Dubai critically, calling it a city without character."
"As the British writer Lawrence Osborne notes, ""the metropolis full of extremes and contradictions has taken the dimension of tacky grotesque""."
"It has turned into a futuristic nightmare completely dominated by the ""Guinness Book of Records"", the unofficial constitution of the emirate."
Because here everything has to be bigger and prettier than anywhere else in the world.
"Among the thicket of excesses and ostentatious luxury, however, something is missing, which in old Europe is perhaps not very transparent but essential for the quality of life."
"In Wrocław, Berlin or Madrid, everyone feels at home."
"And in Dubai, definitely not."
"Running away from the world of magic, I ripped off its golden mask, revealing the second face of an artificial paradise."
A face that is not spoken about and written about.
"I show the misery of Asians contrasting with the fairy-tale living conditions of the divine caste of ethnic Dubai's, the grandsons of illiterate Bedouins."
"I venture into places of extreme poverty, for example to a ghetto on the outskirts of a city where an army of Asian workers lives in cruel conditions."
They were the ones who built the sky-high desert Manhattan in one generation in slave conditions.
They came here deluded by good wages and the possibility of ensuring a decent life for their families and found a nightmare.
A tourist will never see this because it could blow up the myth of Dubai created over the years.
Increasingly frequent criticism of the international community makes the topic of cheap labor highly embarrassing for the Emir.
Spice Girls' Mel C has banned talking about diets in her home after her struggle with an eating disorder
"Melanie Chisholm from Spice Girls admitted that her home is banned from dieting after struggling with eating disorders for years, eating only fruit and vegetables."
"Sporty Spice did not eat for years and was ""obsessively exercising"" due to the pressures of being a member of a world famous pop group, which later resulted in depression and eating disorders."
"She now reveals that her experiences influence the way she raises her daughter Scarlet and therefore ""does not allow diets to be talked about in her home""."
"Scarlet is 10 now and I am beginning to see that she is more aware of her appearance, Mel said."
"I believe that one of the positives of experiencing an eating disorder is that I am very aware of the way I speak in front of her.
It has now become my habit to use positive language.
In an interview with Women's Health magazine, Mel, who rose to fame in the 1990s as a member of the Spice Girls band, said that in the pre-social media days, ""outrageous"" comments in the press about her made her feel complex."
"I started to look at myself inappropriately, giving up certain food groups, exercising more and more obsessively until I became underweight, she says."
I was sick and it probably lasted for several years.
A photo that shook the world
The Polish girl and the American documentary filmmaker gave the world a testimony of the cruelty of war.
The legendary photo of Julien Bryan can be seen at the Museum of the Second World War in Gdańsk
"Hear my story.
I speak from the besieged city of Warsaw.
I can and must speak on behalf of the Polish nation about what happened here.
America must act, must help! documentary photographer Julien Bryan began his radio speech."
"On the tragic days of September 1939, he saw the drama of the bombed city and its inhabitants in the Polish capital."
His account echoed widely in the West.
"The President of Warsaw, Stefan Starzyński, first helped him, borrowed a car, but then asked him to leave immediately for his own safety."
"Bryan wrote a farewell letter to his family in the US, deposited it in an embassy safe and ... stayed."
"For the next four weeks, he tried to be everywhere where Warsaw residents."
400 planes and artillery attacked the city almost non-stop.
"Bryan photographed death, suffering, a struggle to survive in the ruins of the city."
"Just before the capitulation, he and the embassy employees took the negatives overseas."
He did not stop talking about Hitler's crimes.
"He appealed to the world: ""What happened to Warsaw will meet Paris, London and even New York""."
His shocking chronicles were viewed by President Eleanor Roosevelt.
Soon the US began to prepare for war.
"Dad showed the truth and thus fought against German propaganda.
They made films that glorified their chivalry.
They said they didn't attack women and children, and people believed them, says Sam Bryan, Julien's son."
A jury trial against a former athlete accused of multiple rapes
A jury trial is pending against a former University of Delaware baseball player accused of multiple sexual assaults.
"On Friday, after 10 days of testifying and listening to arguments, members of the jury began to decide the fate of 23-year-old Clay Conaway."
A woman who turned 21 claims that Conaway raped her when she went to his house in June 2018.
The incident took place three weeks after the two made an acquaintance on the Bumble meetings page and the man sent the woman a photo of himself showing himself naked.
The woman is one of six accusing Conaway of sexual assault in 2013-2018.
"According to the accusers, the hugging to which the woman agreed turned into a rape, which was met with her opposition."
"Defenders cite the woman's conflicting accounts and gaps in memory, and claim that the woman probably regretted having an intimate relationship."
Gold on two wheels: Polish bike for a million zlotys
A gold-plated bicycle worth one million zlotys was on display at the 10th anniversary of the International Bicycle Fair in Kielce BIKE-EXPO.
This is an unusual vehicle printed on a 3D printer.
Its designer 30-year-old Adam Zdanowicz has just received a bicycle Oscar for him at the World Custom Bicycle Exhibition in Las Vegas.
The unusual copy made a sensation at the fair. - The bike is covered with gold spray chrome underneath it is the highest quality silver.
This is an unusual coating made by my friend from Żory.
"There is a saddle, there are pedals, there is a steering wheel, you could ride it normally.
It can develop speeds of 50 kilometers per hour.
It is an electric bicycle that is specified by its designer."
"The bicycle body was printed on a 3D printer.
They are cubes that form a kind of vortex.
I came up with the idea for this model while riding my first bike home a few years ago.
I drew it on a piece of paper and put it deep in a drawer.
The sketch waited five years for implementation.
The bike itself was built for three years, adds Adam Zdanowicz."
"It was cruelly difficult to hide all the elements under the body.
Inside there are batteries, wires and elements that make up the structure.
It is hidden under the body, slid in 11 elements on the steel frame of the bicycle.
The engine is also hidden there.
The handlebar for this bike was made a week before my departure to the United States for the World Bicycle Exhibition.
Until the end I could not decide what this steering wheel should be.
She folds up for transport.
The bike weighs 90 kilograms, he sums up."
"The gold-plated bike was recognized in Las Vegas in the most important competition category ""Best Amazing Custom Single""."
The footage shows heavy pollution of popular tourist spots
"Sydney Bay surrounded by the opera house, Circular Quay harbor, Luna Park amusement park and of course the famous Harbor Bridge make a significant contribution to the amount of 219 billion dollars annually pumped into the Australian economy by tourists visiting Sydney."
"However, there is an ugly truth under the bridge."
"The well-known Sydney Bay is one of the most polluted waterways in the country, and it is influenced annually by a volume of pollution equal to the capacity of about 15 Olympic swimming pools."
These terrifying statistics mean that one of our greatest tourist assets is also one of our dirtiest reservoirs.
"According to new footage titled ""Sydney Bay - Up and Down"", the waters around Australia's most popular city are full of plastic netting butts and bottles of lost shoes and clothing, and even dead animals, all draining into the bay with the rainwater."
"However, the biggest component choking our shipping channels is plastic."
"I would call it a paradox, says Dr. Katherine Dafforn, deputy director of the Sydney Harbor Research Program, in the video published on September 27, with the release of this film deliberately coinciding with World Tourism Day."
This reservoir looks beautiful but is one of the most altered and contaminated estuaries along our coast.
"The CSIRO agency estimates that every hour about 1,560 kg of plastic gets into our waterways, and most of it flows into the bay through storm sewers."
"After such heavy rainfall, the bay ... it looks pretty tragic, said Dr. Dafforn."
Two-thirds of the pollution comes from rainwater.
"However, as with the iceberg, the problem with Sydney Bay is much more serious below the surface of the water as 70% of the plastic that gets into the ocean ends up on the seabed."
"In my opinion, unless you spend time underwater, you can't really realize what's deep down there, said Dive Center Manly owner Richard Nicholls, noting that he and his team pull about 500 kg of plastic a year from the water on their own."
I think if more people knew (what is under the water) they would be just terrified.
It's overwhelming ... more than half of what we find at the bottom is plastic nets.
The remaining 50% are things that are at least made of plastic.
When you look at the bay it looks beautiful and people can't believe that all this plastic and all that rubbish we are picking up right under the surface.
Jeremy Brown Co-Founder and Managing Director of Ocean Protect stated that there are ways in which people - both locals and tourists - could help reduce the amount of plastic and debris entering our waterways.
"It has to start at the source, he said."
"We need to reduce the amount of plastic we use, better recycle materials, and be more aware of what we discharge in the wastewater that ends up in the oceans."
"If we destroy the ocean, we will be doomed because 50% of the oxygen we breathe comes from the ocean."
It absorbs 30% of carbon dioxide and is our food source.
"However, we can tidy up this bay and restore it to its former glory, and it's very simple."
"If we kill our oceans, we will kill ourselves."
The footage funded by the recycling company TOMRA as part of its wider efforts to educate Australians about protecting the environment and reducing the negative impact of beverage containers that frequently end up in the environment coincides with a study on the relationship between plastics and mental health published this month.
